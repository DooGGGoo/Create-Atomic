# Create:Atomic

 Mod is currently WIP so there is not much to see
 -
 Addon for Create that adds nuclear energy and radiation
 
 TODO:
 RBMK Reactor (Yes,like in HBM Nuclear Tech)
 
 Radiation and different ways to prevent it [~30% done]
 
 Various types of fuel and modifiers for is (Kinda like fireworks work in vanilla) so you can experiment with things and make your reactors go boom
 
 More than 1 type of reactor, something like breedeng reactor or RTG's for times, when you dont have much space/time to setup reactor
 
 Usage for depleted uranium, maybe armor piercing rods for crossbow or just decorative blocks
